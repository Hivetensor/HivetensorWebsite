        {
          question: "What is Hivetensor?",
          answer: "Hivetensor is a decentralized platform that combines artificial intelligence competitions with cryptocurrency rewards. Think of it as 'Kaggle meets Cryptocurrency' - miners compete to solve real-world AI challenges and earn Bitcoin for their contributions. We're democratizing AI development by creating a global, permissionless network of machine learning researchers and practitioners."
        },
        {
          question: "How do I get started mining on Hivetensor?",
          answer: "Getting started is simple: 1) Download the Hivetensor client from our docs page, 2) Create your miner account and set up your wallet, 3) Browse active challenges and pick ones that match your skills, 4) Submit your solutions and compete for rewards. No special hardware required beyond a decent computer - though GPU access helps for deep learning challenges."
        },
        {
          question: "Do I need to be an AI expert to participate?",
          answer: "Not at all! We have challenges for every skill level. Beginner challenges might involve basic data analysis or simple machine learning tasks, while expert challenges tackle cutting-edge research problems. Our tutorials and bootcamp materials help you level up your skills progressively."
        },
        {
          question: "What hardware do I need?",
          answer: "For most challenges, a standard laptop or desktop computer is sufficient. However, deep learning challenges may benefit from GPU acceleration. We recommend at least 8GB RAM and a modern CPU. Cloud computing resources like Google Colab or AWS can also be used for more demanding tasks."

      questions: [
        {
          question: "How are challenges evaluated?",
          answer: "Each challenge specifies its evaluation metric (accuracy, F1-score, BLEU, etc.) and validation process. Solutions are typically evaluated on a held-out test set that participants can't access. Rankings are updated in real-time, and final rewards are distributed based on leaderboard positions when the challenge ends."
        },
        {
          question: "Can I submit multiple solutions to the same challenge?",
          answer: "Yes! You can submit multiple solutions to improve your score. However, there may be daily submission limits to prevent spam. Your best score is what counts for the final ranking. We encourage iterative improvement and learning from feedback."
        },
        {
          question: "What types of AI challenges are available?",
          answer: "We host challenges across all major AI domains: Computer Vision (image classification, object detection), Natural Language Processing (sentiment analysis, translation), Time Series (forecasting, anomaly detection), Reinforcement Learning (game playing, robotics), and more. Challenges range from academic research problems to real-world industry applications."
        },
        {
          question: "How are prize pools determined?",
          answer: "Prize pools are set by challenge sponsors - companies, research institutions, or individuals who want to crowdsource AI solutions. Larger, more complex challenges typically have higher rewards. The total pool is distributed among top performers, with the exact distribution specified for each challenge."
        },
        {
          question: "Can I collaborate with other miners?",
          answer: "This depends on the specific challenge rules. Some challenges allow team submissions, while others require individual work. Check each challenge's terms carefully. However, general discussion and knowledge sharing in our community forums is always encouraged!"

      category: "Rewards & Payments",
      icon: "üí∞",
      questions: [
        {
          question: "How do I earn cryptocurrency rewards?",
          answer: "Rewards are earned by ranking highly in challenge leaderboards. The exact payout structure is specified for each challenge, but typically the top 10-20% of participants receive rewards proportional to their ranking. Payments are made in Bitcoin automatically after challenge completion."
        },
        {
          question: "When do I receive my rewards?",
          answer: "Rewards are typically distributed within 48 hours of challenge completion, after final verification and fraud checks. You'll need to provide a valid Bitcoin wallet address in your profile to receive payments. All transactions are recorded on the blockchain for transparency."
        },
        {
          question: "Are there minimum payout thresholds?",
          answer: "Yes, to minimize transaction fees, there's a minimum payout threshold of 0.001 BTC (approximately $30-50 depending on current prices). Smaller rewards accumulate in your account until you reach the threshold. You can view your current balance in your miner dashboard."
        },
        {
          question: "How are taxes handled?",
          answer: "Hivetensor does not provide tax advice. Cryptocurrency earnings may be subject to taxation in your jurisdiction. You're responsible for reporting earnings according to your local tax laws. We recommend consulting with a tax professional familiar with cryptocurrency regulations."
        },
        {
          question: "What happens if there are technical issues or disputes?",
          answer: "We have a dispute resolution process for technical issues, evaluation errors, or suspected cheating. Contact our support team with detailed information. In cases of platform errors, affected participants will be compensated fairly. Serious violations like data leakage or cheating result in disqualification and potential bans."

      questions: [
        {
          question: "What programming languages and frameworks can I use?",
          answer: "You're free to use any programming language and framework you prefer! Python with scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch are most common, but R, Julia, C++, and others are welcome. What matters is the quality of your solution, not the tools you use to build it."
        },
        {
          question: "How do I submit my solutions?",
          answer: "Solutions are submitted through the Hivetensor client application. You'll typically upload prediction files, model outputs, or complete model implementations depending on the challenge requirements. Each challenge provides clear submission guidelines and file format specifications."
        },
        {
          question: "Can I use pre-trained models and external data?",
          answer: "This varies by challenge. Some allow pre-trained models and external datasets, while others restrict participants to provided data only. Always check the specific rules for each challenge. Using prohibited resources can result in disqualification."
        },
        {
          question: "How is the platform secured against cheating?",
          answer: "We employ multiple anti-cheating measures: held-out test sets that participants can't access, submission limits, plagiarism detection, anomaly detection in results, and community reporting. Serious violations result in immediate disqualification and potential permanent bans."
        },
        {
          question: "Is my code and intellectual property protected?",
          answer: "You retain ownership of your code and models. However, by participating, you grant Hivetensor limited rights to evaluate your submissions. We never share your code with others unless explicitly required by challenge rules. Some challenges may require open-source solutions - this is always clearly stated upfront."

          question: "Can I create my own challenges?",
          answer: "Yes! Organizations and individuals can sponsor their own challenges through our challenge creation platform. You define the problem, provide the dataset, set the prize pool, and we handle the infrastructure and community engagement. It's a great way to crowdsource solutions to your specific AI problems."
        },
        {
          question: "How do I stay updated on new challenges and platform updates?",
